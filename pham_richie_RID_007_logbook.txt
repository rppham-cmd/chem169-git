Working with Git in both the terminal and Colab was confusing at first because there are multiple environments (local computer, GitHub, and Colab) and it was hard to remember which one I was working in. Authentication with personal access tokens was also tricky because the token is hidden when you paste it and has to be regenerated if lost. What helped me get unstuck was carefully following the step-by-step workflow and using git status often to understand what Git expected next. Seeing how files move from untracked to staged to committed made the workflow much clearer. I also learned the importance of pushing and pulling to keep the local and remote repositories synchronized. One key thing I learned is that Git does not automatically track changes — you must explicitly add and commit them. Overall, this exercise helped me understand the full Git workflow from creating files to syncing changes with GitHub.
